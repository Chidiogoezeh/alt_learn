# Getting input from a user, here a user is allowed to input\
# required information into our program. We can store this input\
# inside a variable which we can use. These are ways to make your program more interactive

name = input("Enter your name: ") # Here name is a variable set to input
age = input("Enter your age: ") # You can add different variables you require from the user 
print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age + "years old !") # Run code, python requires you input a value
